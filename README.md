# The Complete API Handbook (JavaScript Edition)

Welcome to the Web APIs Source Code repository! This repository contains all the source codes referenced in my API article series, which you can find on both [Dev.to](https://dev.to) and [Medium](https://medium.com).

In this repository, you will find various examples and implementations of simple yet powerful Web APIs that you can quickly master and implement in your own projects. These examples are designed to help you understand and utilize the capabilities of modern web browsers to create rich, interactive web applications.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
